# Python-Data-Science-Machine-Learning

This repository contains code examples in python, related to Data Science and Machine Learning libraries, such as handling Numpy arrays, handling Pandas data framnes, calling SQL csv.files in Pandas, calling HTTTP and HTTPS files in Pandas, Usage and understanding of Matplotlib, drawing plots off of Matplotlib.pyplot, drawing and analysing data plots in Seaborn and other Python Data Science libraries. It also shows code examples regarding Data handling using Data science scope, Data handling, extracting data, and setting up Pandas Dataframes from raw data to implement Machine learning algorthims on them.

Machine Learning portion of this Repo. is consists of implementing Machine learning algorithms, e.g Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest neighbors, Decision Trees and random Forests, K-means clustring, support vector machine, NPL and building projects off of these algorithms using Python Library Sci-kit learn.
